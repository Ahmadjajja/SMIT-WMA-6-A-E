Web Designing Crash Course Hackathon

Hello everyone!

I hope you are all doing well and keeping up with the assignments. we're going to build a website based on the design provided in the Figma file. 

But that's not all - you will also need to make sure that your website is fully responsive, so it looks great on any device. This is an important skill to have as a developer, so make sure to put in your best effort!

I know some of you may be feeling a little overwhelmed with all of the work we've been doing lately, but I know you're capable of producing some amazing work. So let's get to it!

As always, if you have any questions or need help, don't hesitate to reach out to me or your classmates. Let's make this a fun and productive Hackathon.

Good luck, and have fun!
