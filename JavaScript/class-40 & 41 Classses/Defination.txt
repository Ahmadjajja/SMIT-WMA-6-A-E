1) Classes:-
    Class is itself is not a object. This is basically a blueprint of the object.
    
    example:

    class person {
        constructor(params){

        }
    }

    let personObject1 = new person(values for params);


2) Constructor Function:-
    This is just like another functions, that automatically called when
    object is created.
    Why constructor function uses?
        Because we want initialize the values of our properties.

Classes contains two things:
    1) Properties
    2) Methods

3) Properties or Data members:-
    Properties are just normal variable, but object oriented programming we called these
    variable as properties and data members.
    Note:
        we access this data member in class via this keyword

    class person {
        constructor(name, height){
            this.personName = name;
            this.personHeight = height;
        }
    }
    let obj1 = new person("Ali", "5.5 inch");
    let obj1 = new person("Ahmad", "5.8 inch");


4) Methods or Members functions
    These functions works similar as normal functions.But in OOP(Object Oriented Programming) these are
    called as methods or Member functions.
    Note:
        These functions syntax is'nt include function keyword

    Example:- 

    class person {
        constructor(name, height){
            this.personName = name;
            this.personHeight = height;
        }
        show(){
            console.log(`${this.name} have ${this.height} height`)
        }
    }
    let obj1 = new person("Ali", "5.5 inch");
    let obj1 = new person("Ahmad", "5.8 inch");
    obj1.show();    // Ali have 5.5 inch height

5) Static Keyword:
    This keyword is used when we want to access date members and members functions
    without creating object of that class.
    Note:
        These data members and member functions are accessed via className.methodName or className.methodName

    example:

    class person {
        constructor(name, height){
            this.personName = name;
            this.personHeight = height;
            this.nationality = "pakistani"
        }
        show(){
            console.log(`${this.name} have ${this.height} height`)
        }

        static nationality = "Pakistani";
        static religion(){
            console.log(`90% chances are this ${person.nationality} man can be muslim`)
        }

    }

    console.log(person.nationality);    // Pakistani
    person.religion();                  // 90% chances are this pakistani man can be muslim

6) Inheritance
    In  inheritance, child class can access data members(properties) and member function(methods) of parent class.
    Note: 
        You can perform inheritance upto any level that you want

    Two main keywords comes:
        1) extends
            This keyword uses for creating child class of parent class.
        2) super() method
            This method uses in child class constructor function
            Used for calling constructor function of parent class.

            example : 
                class animal {
                    constructor(legs){
                        this.legs = legs;
                    }
                }
                class dog extends animal {
                    constructor(legs, age){
                        super(legs);
                        this.age = age;
                    }
                }
