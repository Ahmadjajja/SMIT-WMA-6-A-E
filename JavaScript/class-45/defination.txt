Asynchronous JavaScript is a programming paradigm that allows JavaScript code to execute non-blocking operations. 
In traditional synchronous programming, each line of code is executed one after another, and the program waits for 
each operation to complete before moving on to the next one. Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, enables 
JavaScript to perform tasks in the background while other operations are being executed, without blocking the execution flow.
