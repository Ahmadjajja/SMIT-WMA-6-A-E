// In JavaScript, a generator function is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed
// during its execution. It allows you to control the flow of execution manually and generate a sequence
// of values over time.

// Generator functions are particularly useful when you need to generate a large sequence of values lazily
//  or when dealing with asynchronous code. They provide an elegant way to control and manage the flow of
//  asynchronous operations.
