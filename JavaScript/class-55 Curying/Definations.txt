// Currying is a technique in functional programming that involves transforming a function with multiple
// arguments into a sequence of functions, each taking only one argument. The curried function returns a
// new function for each argument, allowing partial application of arguments.

// This transformation allows for partial application of arguments, meaning you can provide some arguments
// upfront and later provide the remaining arguments when needed.
