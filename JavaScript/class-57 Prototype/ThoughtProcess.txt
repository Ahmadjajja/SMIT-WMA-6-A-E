Prototype Visualy representation :-
Note - Every object in javascript have prototype
let cowObject =  { color: "Brown" }                          | prototype of cow = {age: "10"}        | null




cowObject ====================> constructor =================> Prototype ===========================> Prototype ===========================> Prototype
|                           |                              |                                             -

                               prototype                                                -
                                                                                -

is object                   1- creates object              1- blueprint
                            2- used for accessing          2- It self object
                               prototype




Method for accessing prototype of object
1- console.log(myObj.constructor.prototype)
2- console.log(myObj.__proto__)

3 things comes in protyping concept:
1- object
2- constructor function
3- prototype chain


Note Key things here:
1- Object created through simple braces i.e {}              
    a - By-default, this have two prototypes
    b - There may be chain of prototypes upto any numbers

2- Object created through hard code i.e 

        function Cow(color) {
            this.color = color;
        }
        Cow.prototype.age = "10";
        let cowObject = new Cow("Brown");

    a- By-default, This will have one more prototype than simple method
    b- There may also chain of prototypes upto any numbers


What's the use and what's the importance of prototypes??
    1- If we does'nt find value in object itself, this will check value from all 
       prototype untill it found last prototype



How we can add chain of prototypes??
